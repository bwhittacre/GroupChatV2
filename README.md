The purpose of this software is to create a private peer to peer communication service.

# Network Communication

This is a peer to peer system.

This uses UDP and is transmitted through the IP address 239.0.0.0 with the port of 1234.

UDP follows the format of having a source port, destination, length, checksum, and data package. This is all sent in a datagram.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my IDE.

This was written in Java with the libraries java.net, java.io, and java.util.Scanner.

# Future Work
* Create GUI.
* Add settings to change password and other aspects of the interface.
* Add the integration of other characters, languages, emojis, and perhaps filesharing.
